This is a tool I developed for a project I am working on (the same one that needs the fork of McAssetExtractor). 
It's not intended for public use, although I may make a modified, more accessible version in the future.

SRGerator parses through retroguard script files and converts method and field names from SRG intermediaries to 
meaningful names found in csv files. It is written in Java 8 and uses OpenCSV as a dependency.
